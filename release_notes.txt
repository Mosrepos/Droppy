## v4.6 - Appearance Consistency Update

### Fixed
- Transparent background setting now only applies to windows (Settings, Clipboard, Update) and not the shelf/notch, which always stays solid black for a cleaner look
- Updated setting description to clarify behavior: "Use glass effect for windows (not shelf)"
