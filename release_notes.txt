# Droppy v2.6.4 Hotfix 🩹

Critical stability update for the Notch Window.

### 🛠 Fixes
- **Crash Resolved**: Fixed a persistent crash caused by high-frequency fullscreen detection monitoring.
- **Performance**: Separated window interaction logic (50ms) from environmental checks (1s), significantly reducing CPU and memory usage in the background.

This is the definitive fix for the `objc_release` crash. Thanks mainly to the detailed stack traces submitted by users! 🕵️‍♂️
